           SHORT="Unified framework for all forms of real time conversations"

cat << EOF
The Telepathy project aims to provide a unified framework for all forms of real
time conversations, including instant messaging, IRC, voice calls and video
calls. It uses the D-Bus messaging system to provide a simple interface for
client applications, allowing them to quickly benefit from Telepathy's
functionality.

At the core of Telepathy is the DBus interface specification which describes how
Telepathy components communicate with each other. We are up to spec version 0.17
(see DbusSpec for older versions). For a more approachable introduction to the
structure of the framework, try the System Overview document. The Ubuntu spec
for SIP/IM integration includes a good rationale for this distributed approach.
