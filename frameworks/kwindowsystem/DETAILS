Convenience access to certain properties and features of the windowing system.

KWindowSystem provides information about the windowing system and allows interaction with
the windowing system. It provides an high level API which is windowing system independent and
has platform specific implementations. This API is inspired by X11 and thus not all functionality
is available on all windowing systems.

In addition to the high level API, this framework also provides several more low level classes
for interaction with the X Windowing System.
