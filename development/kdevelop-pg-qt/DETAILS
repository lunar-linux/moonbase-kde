cat << EOF
KDevelop-PG-Qt is the parser-generator from KDevplatform. It is used for some
KDevelop-languagesupport-plugins (Ruby, PHP, Java...).

It uses Qt classes internally. There's also the original KDevelop-PG parser,
which used types from the STL, but has since been superseeded by KDevelop-PG-Qt.
Most of the features are the same, though it could be that the ...-Qt parser
generator is more up to date and feature rich than the plain STL style
generator. The ...-Qt version should be used to write parsers for KDevelop
language plugins.
