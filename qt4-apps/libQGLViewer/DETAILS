cat << EOF
libQGLViewer is a C++ library based on Qt that eases the creation of OpenGL 3D 
viewers. It provides some of the typical 3D viewer functionalities, such as the
possibility to move the camera using the mouse, which lacks in most of the other
APIs. Other features include mouse manipulated frames, interpolated keyFrames, 
object selection, stereo display, screenshot saving and much more. It can be 
used by OpenGL beginners as well as to create complex applications, being fully
customizable and easy to extend.
