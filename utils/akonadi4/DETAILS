cat << EOF
Akonadi is a PIM layer, which provides an asynchronous API to access
all kind of PIM data (e.g. mails, contacts, events, todos etc.).
It consists of several processes (generally called the Akonadi server)
and a library (called client library) which encapsulates the
communication between the client and the server.
This directory contains the sources of the Akonadi server and all the
infrastructure that is needed to build the client libraries and the
application which want to make use of Akonadi.
