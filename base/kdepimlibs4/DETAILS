NOTE: this is still needed even though there is a kdepimlibs in the
applications directory.


This module includes libraries that are central to the development and
execution of a KDE-PIM application.

The KDE-PIM project aims to bring together those who wish to help design,
implement, test, etc. anything that's to do with personal information
